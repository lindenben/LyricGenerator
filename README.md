# LyricGenerator

LyricGenerator is a project to generate song lyrics from a starting string using NLP techniques and a database of existing song lyrics.

The idea is to look for lyrics that are slightly similar to the starting string and therefore would make sense as part of the same song. This process is repeated for the next lyric and the previous lyric becomes the 'starting string'.

The lyrics produced tend to make sense and at the very least provides a good starting point for a song.

## Future Ideas

- Incorporate sentiment analysis to ensure the tone of the lyrics remain consistent
- Add rhyming functionality
